# Single Sign-On (SSO) Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication.

## What is SSO?

Single Sign-On (SSO) is an authentication system that allows users to access multiple applications with a single set of login credentials. 

Key features:
- One-time login for multiple services
- Centralized authentication
- Reduced password fatigue
- Improved security through token-based access

## How It Works

1. User logs in once with their credentials
2. System verifies identity and issues an authentication token
3. Token grants access to all connected applications
4. No additional logins required for authorized services

## Implementation Details

### Prerequisites
- [.NET Core 6.0+]()
- [IdentityServer4]() (or your SSO provider)
- [Entity Framework Core]()
- [SQL Server]() (or your preferred database)

### Configuration

1. Set up your SSO provider (e.g., IdentityServer4):
```json
"IdentityServer": {
  "Authority": "https://your-sso-server.com",
  "ClientId": "your-client-id",
  "ClientSecret": "your-client-secret"
}
